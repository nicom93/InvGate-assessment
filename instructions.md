# UI Develop Evaluation

Convert one section of the provided UI image to HTML and CSS code (native, SASS or LESS), using the tools that seem convenient, providing the necessary files for their evaluation. You can choose which section you want to work with (they are marked as SECTION A, B and C in the ui-sections file) but add the overall column layout to place the desired section in place. Feel free to do more than one if you want to. Complementary icons and font are provided. The example images do not have to be the same, you can use any image. The UI image is delivered in 2x resolution.

We are going to evaluate:

- Style
    - Quality: how much close to the original
    - Interpretation: how similar elements can be merged into one concept or class
    - Vision: take into account what variants could eventually emerge to generate future-proof code
    - Responsive: what would be convenient to modify or make flexible for different resolutions
- Code
    - Efficiency: how much code you need and how easy is to update it
    - Reusability: how flexible the classes are to be used in different situations
    - Scaling: how flexible it is to eventually extend the uses or elements
    - Order: what parameters are used to define the classes, names, grouping, files. We internally use ideas from BEM ([Link](https://en.bem.info/methodology/naming-convention/)) for naming classes.
